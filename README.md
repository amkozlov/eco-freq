In many regions with a high share of renewables - such as Germany, Spain, UK or California - CO2 emissions per kWh of electricity may vary two-fold within a single day, and up to four-fold within a year. This is due to both, variable production from solar and wind, and variable demand (peak hours vs. night-time/weekends). Hence, reducing energy consumption during these periods of high carbon intesity leads to overproportionate CO2 savings. This is exactly the idea behind EcoFreq: it modulates CPU/GPU power consumption *in realtime* according to the current "greenness" of the grid energy mix. Importantly, this modulation is absolutely transparent to user applications: they will run as usual without interruption, "accelerating" in times when energy comes mostly from renewables, and being throttled when fossil generation increases. 

And it gets even better if you have a dynamic electricity tariff ([example1](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/), [example2](https://tibber.com/en)) or solar panels: (being an) EcoFreq can save you a few cents ;)

TL;DR Just look at those awesome plots from [electricitymap.org](https://www.electricitymap.org) and you'll get the idea:

## Installation

Prerequisites:
 - Linux system (tested with Ubuntu and CentOS)
 - Python3.7+ with `pip`
 - (optional) API token -> [Which real-time CO2/price provider to use?](https://github.com/amkozlov/eco-freq/blob/main/config/README.md/) 
 - (optional) [`ipmitool`](https://github.com/ipmitool/ipmitool) to use IPMI power measurements


Please run installer script which will register `systemd` service and create a basic config file for EcoFreq:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

Alternatively, you can specify a custom config file (see [examples](https://github.com/amkozlov/eco-freq/blob/main/config)):

```
sudo ./install.sh my.ecofreq.cfg
```


## Usage

* For a quick test of EcoFreq on your system without configuration overhead (using mock CO2 provider): 

```
sudo ./ecofreq.py -c config/mock.cfg -l test.log
```

* After installing EcoFreq as a service, you can use standard `systemctl` commands to control it.  

```
sudo systemctl start ecofreq
sudo systemctl status ecofreq
sudo systemctl stop ecofreq
```

Command-line tool `ecoctl` allows to query and control the EcoFreq service. 
If you want to run `ecoctl` without `sudo` (recommended), either add your user to the `ecofreq` group,
or [configure socket permissions accordingly](https://github.com/amkozlov/eco-freq/blob/main/doc/CONFIG.md#Server). 

* Show EcoFreq status:

```
./ecoctl.py
```

* Change power scaling policy:

```
./ecoctl.py policy co2:step:100=0.7:200=0.5

./ecoctl.py policy const:50%

./ecoctl.py policy maxperf
```

* Report energy and CO2 for a program run (assuming it runs exclusively -> to be improved): 

```
./ecorun.py sleep 10

time_s:     10.003
pwr_avg_w:  88.724
energy_j:   887.5
energy_kwh: 0.0
co2_g:      0.098
cost_ct:    0.001
```

* Report energy and CO2 statistics for a local EcoFreq instance (default log file):

```
./ecostat.py

EcoStat v0.0.1
